# redquasar-ublue

My attempt at making a ublue spin.

Oregano content, donut steel. Or do, idc lol.

## How to use it

`rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ahallrq/redquasar-ublue:latest`

This changes constantly and is entirely for my own personal use. Don't blame me if you destroy your computer.

## Note

I've cannabalised scripts from other Atomic builds and have tried to provide credit in the files where due (mostly via a link to the respective repo). I may have missed some things though. Because I am terrible at writing shell scripts, some scripts were written with the assistance of AIâ„¢. They work though so she'll be roight.


Despite having "ublue" in the name this is an unofficial build and not endorsed by the Universal Blue project. I'm just too lazy to rename it atm.
