# redquasar-ublue

My attempt at making a ublue spin.

Oregano content, donut steel. Or do, idc lol

## How to use it

`rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ahallrq/redquasar-ublue:latest`

This changes constantly and is entirely for my own personal use. Don't blame me if you destroy your computer.

## Note

I've cannabalised scripts from other Atomic builds and have tried to provide credit in the files where due (mostly via a link to the respective repo). I may have missed some things though.
